## 🎯 ADVERSARIAL TESTING SCHEDULE

### **Phase 1: Foundation Challenge (Current)**
- **Week Focus:** Challenge core assumptions about conservative thresholds
- **Key Questions:**
  - When does conservatism cost more than it saves?
  - What's the optimal threshold mathematically?
  - Are there scenarios where t=100 is demonstrably wrong?

### **Phase 2: Statistical Rigor Challenge (Next)**
- **Week Focus:** Challenge statistical methods and assumptions
- **Key Questions:**
  - Are there better statistical approaches?
  - Do the assumptions hold under production conditions?
  - What are the failure modes of the statistical approach?

### **Phase 3: Production Reality Challenge (Future)**
- **Week Focus:** Challenge production readiness and safety claims
- **Key Questions:**
  - What breaks under production stress?
  - Are there hidden failure modes?
  - Is the security model adequate?

### **Phase 4: Business Value Challenge (Future)**
- **Week Focus:** Challenge business value and ROI claims
- **Key Questions:**
